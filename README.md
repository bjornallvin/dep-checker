This a simple app for analysizing dependencies for a monorepo.

Point it to the repo root and it will list info on dependencies (wanted versio by projects, resolved versions from lockfile, and the latest available version from npm)

Only to be run on local environment

Todo:
- Make the selection of repo root path flexible
- Colorise based on diff from latest version availble
- Add link to npm package information
